Waffle is a Twitter-style social media web application that enables users to determine an age range for the recipients of their messages. The idea came to me as I was scrolling through Twitter and saw a rather explicit joke, which made me wonder why such messages do not have a determined age range to prevent children from being exposed to material not appropriate to their age. I then used Node.js and Express to set up the foundation of the application. I also incorporated MongoDB to keep track of user and message data. To ensure data security and privacy, I utilized Passport.js for authentication as well as a dotenv file for sensitive information. The design was made possible through the usage of the Bootstrap framework.
